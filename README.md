# üìù Assembly barcode generator (code39 specification)

Project for my university course in which the task was to build a program in MIPS assembly. The program had to generate a bitmap (.bmp file) containing a correct barcode (according to [code39 specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_39)) based on a provided string of characters and the width of the narrow bar.

## Usage

To run the program, you need to obtain the Mars simulator (an integrated environment for running MIPS assembly written in java) available [here](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/download.htm).

### TODO:

- Finish tests to work correctly
- Write a nice README.md
- Make the project open-source
