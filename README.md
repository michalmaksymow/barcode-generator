# üìù Assembly barcode generator (code39 specification)

A project for my university course in which the task was to build a program in MIPS assembly that would be able
to generate a bitmap (.bmp) containing a correct barcode (according to [code39 specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_39)) based on provided string of characters and width of the narrow bar in pixels.

### TODO:

- Finish tests to work correctly
- Write a nice README.md
- Make the project open-source
